This text file provides details about the measured ET

THES-ET_post_lake and THES-ET_post_marsh are data files containing data tables following the same structure for the lake and marsh.

Hence, below is a summary of descriptions of the data tables presented in each data file:

1. ECData: All the 30-min data from the measurements with Campbell Scientific's instrumentation and EddyPro's results - this table summarizes all raw data required for calculations in the ET paper. 

Rows display different timestamps at 30-min intervals, while rows display different variables. The description of variable names is standard and provided in the two attached pdf documents: Section 3 of the EddyPro manual and Section 4 of the Campbell Scientific manual.
Note that the evapotranspiration measurements contained in this file are calculated by the automatic EasyFlux Campbell Scientific routine and is not the final result. See below for final results.

2. ET: Final ET fluxes at a half-hourly interval at the same timestamps as ECData
3. H: Final H fluxes at a half-hourly interval at the same timestamps as ECData
4. LE: Final LE fluxes at a half-hourly interval at the same timestamps as ECData
