This text file provides details about the different result tables presented for the present experiment:

THES-exp3_results_lake_PET and THES-exp3_results_marsh_PET are data files containing data tables following the same structure for the lake and marsh.

Hence, below is a summary of descriptions of the data tables presented in each data file:

All first level variables have 3 columns, corresponding to the 3 different scenarios (May, July, September)

1. exp3_ET_res_lake[or marsh] contains the modelled PET for all equations, with rows as different timestamps and columns as different equations at the selected month.
2. exp3_gof_res_lake[or marsh] contains the goodness of fit (GoF) measures for all equations, where the 40 rows correspond to different equations and the 10 columns correspond to different GoFs {'pearson';'pval';'rmse';'bic';'mae';'me';'stdE';'pbias';'ns';'d'}, of which only rmse, mae, me and d are used in the non-dominated sorting
3. exp3_indic_lake[or marsh] contains the indicator variables (SMRD and NSE), where the 4 rows correspond to [SMRD, mean NSE,min NSE, max NSE], and 3 columns correspond to different scenarios
4. exp3_rank1idx_lake[or marsh] contains the equation number corresponding to each rank 1 equation, with one row, and 3 columns corresponding to the different scenarios; model numbers follow the same order as exp3_ET_res_lake[or marsh]'s columns
5. exp3_ranknds_lake[or marsh] contains the rank of each equation, with 40 rows corresponding to the different equations (40) in the same order as exp3_rank1idx_lake[or marsh] and exp3_ET_res_lake[or marsh], and different columns (3) corresponding to each scenario.
